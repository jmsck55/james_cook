Light side, or Dark side. I have chosen Light side, and I will receive no money for my programming work. I am just a hobbyist. Be a philanthropist with your money, as I am not receiving it.

The Light side and the Dark side of the force don't understand each other.  The Dark side would make money, the Light side has little use for money.

"More money more problems."  I would request that you donate the money I would have received from my software to charity.  Donate your old car, toys, and other things to charity.  Buy new ones.

It may not be the wisest decision, but it is the easiest choice I could make.

Normally, you wouldn't copyright code that you haven't already made money from.  I am choosing to copyright my code so that other people can use it, without the headache I would have had trying to make a company in order to sell it.

I hope you can still use the software without me forming a company to sell it.

I don't know how to write a EULA.  If you need one, contact me.
